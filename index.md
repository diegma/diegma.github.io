I am a *Post-doc Researcher* at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA] working with Prof. [{{ site.ivantitovstyle }}]({{ site.ivan_titov }}) currently visiting the [School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the University of Edinburgh.

My work mainly focusses on relation extraction and semantic parsing. 
More in general I am interested in supervised and unsupervised neural network approaches (a.k.a. *deep learning*) to natural language understanding.


Here is my [CV]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.cv}}) and here is a quick [bio](pages/background).
