I am a *Post-doc Researcher* at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA] working with Prof. [{{ site.ivantitovstyle }}]({{ site.ivan_titov }}).
My work mainly focusses on semantic relation extraction and semantic parsing. 
More in general I am interested in supervised and unsupervised neural network approaches (a.k.a. *deep learning*) to natural language understanding.


Here in my [CV]({{site.baseurl}}/{{site.cv}}) and here is a quick [background](pages/background).

If you need to find me try Science Park 107 (F2.11).
