  title: Neural Methods for Semantic Role Labeling
  authors: Diego Marcheggiani
  doc-url: /slides/TutorialNNforSRL.pdf
  slides: /slides/TutorialNNforSRL.pdf
  abstract: >
    In this tutorial I present several neural architectures for the task of semantic role labeling. 
    I begin with Hybrid symbolic/neural models to pass to syntax-agnostic neural models and finally Syntax-aware neural models.
