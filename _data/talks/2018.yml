  abstract: >
    Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) is an effective tool for modeling graph-structured data.
    We investigate their applicability in the context of natural language processing (semantic role labeling and machine translation).
    We introduce a version of GCNs suited to modeling syntactic and/or semantic dependency graphs and use them to construct linguistically-informed sentence encoders.
    We demonstrate that using them results in state-of-the-art results on semantic role labeling of English and Chinese and a substantial boost in machine translation performance.
