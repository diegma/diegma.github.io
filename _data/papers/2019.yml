  abstract: >
    Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying predicates and labeling argument spans with semantic roles. 
    Even though most semantic-role formalisms are built upon constituent syntax and only syntactic constituents can be labeled as arguments (e.g., FrameNet and PropBank), all the recent work on syntax-aware SRL relies on dependency representations of syntax. 
    In contrast, we show how graph convolutional networks (GCNs) can be used to encode constituent structures and inform an SRL system. 
    Nodes in our SpanGCN correspond to constituents. The computation is done in 3 stages. 
    First, initial node representations are produced by `composing' word representations of the first and the last word in the constituent. 
    Second, graph convolutions relying on the constituent tree are performed, yielding syntactically-informed constituent representations. 
    Finally, the constituent representations are `decomposed' back into word representations which in turn are used as input to the SRL classifier. 
    We show the effectiveness of our syntax-aware model on standard CoNLL-2005, CoNLL-2012, and FrameNet benchmarks.

  title: 'You Shall Know a User by the Company It Keeps: Dynamic Representations for Social Media Users in NLP'

    Information about individuals can help to better understand what they say, particularly in social media where texts are short. 
    Current approaches to modelling social media users pay attention to their social connections, but exploit this information in a static way, treating all connections uniformly. 
    This ignores the fact, well known in sociolinguistics, that an individual may be part of several communities which are not equally relevant in all communicative situations. 
    We present a model based on Graph Attention Networks that captures this observation. 
    It dynamically explores the social graph of a user, computes a user representation given the most relevant connections for a target task, and combines it with linguistic information to make a prediction. 
    We apply our model to three different tasks, evaluate it against alternative models, and analyse the results extensively, showing that it significantly outperforms other current methods.
