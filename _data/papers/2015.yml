    Microblogging is a model of content sharing in which the temporal locality of posts with respect to important events, either of foreseeable or unforeseeable nature, makes applications of real-time filtering of great practical interest.
    We propose the use of Entity Linking (EL) in order to improve the retrieval effectiveness, by enriching the representation of microblog posts and filtering queries. 
    EL is the process of recognizing in an unstructured text the mention of relevant entities described in a knowledge base. 
    EL of short pieces of text is a difficult task, but it is also a scenario in which the information EL adds to the text can have a substantial impact on the retrieval process.
    We implement a start-of-the-art filtering method, based on the best systems from the TREC Microblog track real-time adhoc retrieval and filtering tasks, and extend it with a Wikipedia-based EL method. 
    Results show that the use of EL significantly improves over non-EL based versions of the filtering methods.

  title: Word Embeddings Go to Italy - A Comparison of Models and Training Datasets
  authors: Giacomo Berardi, Andrea Esuli, Diego Marcheggiani

  abstract: >
    In this paper we present some preliminary results on the generation of word embeddings for the Italian language. 
    We compare two popular word representation models, word2vec and GloVe, and train them on two datasets with different stylistic properties. 
    We test the generated word embeddings on a word analogy test derived from the one originally proposed for word2vec, adapted to capture some of the linguistic aspects that are specific of Italian.
    Results show that the tested models are able to create syntactically and semantically meaningful word embeddings despite the higher morphological complexity of Italian with respect to English. 
    Moreover, we have found that the stylistic properties of the training dataset plays a relevant role in the type of information captured by the produced vectors.

  title: A Multi-lingual Annotated Dataset for Aspect-Oriented Opinion Mining

    We present the Trip-MAML dataset, a Multi-Lingual dataset of hotel reviews that have been manually annotated at the sentence-level with Multi-Aspect sentiment labels. 
    This dataset has been built as an extension of an existent English-only dataset, adding documents written in Italian and Spanish. 
    We detail the dataset construction process, covering the data gathering, selection, and annotation. 
    We present inter-annotator agreement figures and baseline experimental results, comparing the three languages. 
    Trip-MAML is a multi-lingual dataset for aspect-oriented opinion mining that enables researchers (i) to face the problem on languages other than English and (ii) to the experiment the application of cross-lingual learning methods to the task.
