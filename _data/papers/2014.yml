  abstract: >
    Active learning (AL) consists of asking human annotators to annotate automatically selected data that are assumed to bring the most benefit in the creation of a classifier. 
    AL allows to learn accurate systems with much less annotated data than what is required by pure supervised learning algorithms, hence limiting the tedious effort of annotating a large collection of data.
    We experimentally investigate the behavior of several AL strategies for sequence labeling tasks (in a partially-labeled scenario) tailored on Partially-Labeled Conditional Random Fields, on four sequence labeling tasks: phrase chunking, part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition, and bio-entity recognition.

  #   In the introduction, we comment about works that propose some form of exact search. In some cases, authors have proposed algorithms whose applicability seems mostly limited to toy models, such as Aziz et al. (2013). In other cases, authors modified the model in different (non-obvious) ways (e.g. monotone translation, compact rule sets, lower-order LM, entropy pruning for LM) enabling exact search. We mistakenly listed Iglesias et al (2009) amongst the former group, thus misrepresenting their contribution.
  #   A more accurate wording would be:
  #   <blockquote>
  #   To date, most attempts were limited to short sentences and/or somewhat toy models trained with artificially small datasets (Germann et al., 2001; Aziz et al., 2013). Other work has employed less common approximations to the model reducing its search space complexity (Kumar et al., 2006; Iglesias et al., 2009; Chang and Collins, 2011; Rush and Collins, 2011).

  #   I thank Gonzalo Iglesias for kindly warning me about this problem.

    A common feature of many online review sites is the use of an overall rating that summarizes the opinions expressed in a review. 
    Unfortunately, these document-level ratings do not provide any information about the opinions contained in the review that concern a specific aspect (e.g., cleanliness) of the product being reviewed (e.g., a hotel). 
    In this paper we study the finer-grained problem of aspect-oriented opinion mining at the sentence level, which consists of predicting, for all sentences in the review, whether the sentence expresses a positive, neutral, or negative opinion (or no opinion at all) about a specific aspect of the product. 
    For this task we propose a set of increasingly powerful models based on conditional random fields (CRFs), including a hierarchical multi-label CRFs scheme that jointly models the overall opinion expressed in the review and the set of aspect-specific opinions expressed in each of its sentences. 
    We evaluate the proposed models against a dataset of hotel reviews (which we here make publicly available) in which the set of aspects and the opinions expressed concerning them are manually annotated at the sentence level.
    We find that both hierarchical and multi-label factors lead to improved predictions of aspect-oriented opinions.
