  abstract: >
    Most previous work on neural text generation from graph-structured data relies on standard sequence-to-sequence methods. 
    These approaches linearise the input graph to be fed to a recurrent neural network. 
    In this paper, we propose an alternative encoder based on graph convolutional networks that directly exploits the input structure. 
    We report results on two graph-to-sequence datasets that empirically show the benefits of explicitly encoding the input graph structure.

  title: Exploiting Semantics in Neural Machine Translation with Graph Convolutional Networks
  authors: Diego Marcheggiani, Jasmijn Bastings, Ivan Titov
  doc-url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.08313
  booktitle: Proceedings of NAACL-HLT
  poster: /posters/NAACL18.pdf
  venue: conference

  abstract: >
    Semantic representations have long been argued as potentially useful for enforcing meaning preservation and improving generalization performance of machine translation methods. 
    In this work, we are the first to incorporate information about predicate-argument structure of source sentences (namely, semantic-role representations) into neural machine translation. 
    We use Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to inject a semantic bias into sentence encoders and achieve improvements in BLEU scores over the linguistic-agnostic and syntax-aware versions on the English--German language pair.
