  abstract:  >
    In the first year of the TREC Micro Blog track, our participation has focused on
    building from scratch an IR system based on the Whoosh IR library. Though the design
    of our system (CipCipPy) is pretty standard it includes three ad-hoc solutions for the
    track (i) a dedicated indexing function for hashtags that automatically recognizes the
    distinct words composing an hashtag, (ii) expansion of tweets based on the title of any
    referred Web page, and (iii) a tweet ranking function that ranks tweets in results by
    their content quality, which is compared against a reference corpus of Reuters news. In
    this preliminary paper we describe all the components of our system, and the efficacy
    scored by our runs. The CipCipPy system is available under a GPL license.
