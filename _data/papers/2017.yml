    We introduce a simple and accurate neural model for dependency-based semantic role labeling. 
    Our model predicts predicate-argument dependencies relying on states of a bidirectional LSTM encoder. 
    The semantic role labeler achieves respectable performance on English even without any kind of syntactic information and only using local inference. 
    However, when automatically predicted part-of-speech tags are provided as input, it substantially outperforms all previous local models and approaches the best reported results on the CoNLL-2009 dataset. 
    Syntactic parsers are unreliable on out-of-domain data, so standard (i.e. syntactically-informed) SRL models are hindered when tested in this setting. 
    Our syntax-agnostic model appears more robust, resulting in the best reported results on the standard out-of-domain test set.

  title: Encoding Sentences with Graph Convolutional Networks for Semantic Role Labeling
  authors: Diego Marcheggiani, Ivan Titov

  abstract: >
    Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the predicate-argument structure of a sentence. 
    It is typically regarded as an important step in the standard natural language processing pipeline, providing information to downstream tasks such as information extraction and question answering. 
    As the semantic representations are closely related to syntactic ones, we exploit syntactic information in our model. 
    We propose a version of graph convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent class of multilayer neural networks operating on graphs, suited to modeling syntactic dependency graphs. 
    GCNs over syntactic dependency trees are used as sentence encoders, producing latent feature representations of words in a sentence and capturing information relevant to predicting the semantic representations. 
    We observe that GCN layers are complementary to LSTM ones: when we stack both GCN and LSTM layers, we obtain a substantial improvement over an already state-of-the-art LSTM SRL model, resulting in the best reported scores on the standard benchmark (CoNLL-2009) both for Chinese and English.

  title: Graph Convolutional Encoders for Syntax-aware Neural Machine Translation

    We present a simple and effective approach to incorporating syntactic structure into neural attention-based encoder-decoder models for machine translation. 
    We rely on graph-convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent class of neural networks developed for modeling graph-structured data. 
    Our GCNs use predicted syntactic dependency trees of source sentences to produce representations of words (i.e. hidden states of the encoder) that are sensitive to their syntactic neighborhoods. 
    GCNs take word representations as input and produce word representations as output, so they can easily be incorporated as layers into standard encoders (e.g., on top of bidirectional RNNs or convolutional neural networks). 
    We evaluate their effectiveness with English-German and English-Czech translation experiments for different types of encoders and observe substantial improvements over their syntax-agnostic versions in all the considered setups.
