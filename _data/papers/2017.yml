    Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the predicate-argument structure of a sentence. 
    It is typically regarded as an important step in the standard natural language processing pipeline, providing information to downstream tasks such as information extraction and question answering. 
    As the semantic representations are closely related to syntactic ones, we exploit syntactic information in our model. 
    We propose a version of graph convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent class of multilayer neural networks operating on graphs, suited to modeling syntactic dependency graphs. 
    GCNs over syntactic dependency trees are used as sentence encoders, producing latent feature representations of words in a sentence and capturing information relevant to predicting the semantic representations. 
    We observe that GCN layers are complementary to LSTM ones: when we stack both GCN and LSTM layers, we obtain a substantial improvement over an already state-of-the-art LSTM SRL model, resulting in the best reported scores on the standard benchmark (CoNLL-2009) both for Chinese and English.

  title: Graph Convolutional Encoders for Syntax-aware Neural Machine Translation

    We present a simple and effective approach to incorporating syntactic structure into neural attention-based encoder-decoder models for machine translation. 
    We rely on graph-convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent class of neural networks developed for modeling graph-structured data. 
    Our GCNs use predicted syntactic dependency trees of source sentences to produce representations of words (i.e. hidden states of the encoder) that are sensitive to their syntactic neighborhoods. 
    GCNs take word representations as input and produce word representations as output, so they can easily be incorporated as layers into standard encoders (e.g., on top of bidirectional RNNs or convolutional neural networks). 
    We evaluate their effectiveness with English-German and English-Czech translation experiments for different types of encoders and observe substantial improvements over their syntax-agnostic versions in all the considered setups.

  title: A Simple and Accurate Syntax-Agnostic Neural Model for Dependency-based Semantic Role Labeling

    We introduce a simple and accurate neural model for dependency-based semantic role labeling. 
    Our model predicts predicate-argument dependencies relying on states of a bidirectional LSTM encoder. 
    The semantic role labeler achieves respectable performance on English even without any kind of syntactic information and only using local inference. 
    However, when automatically predicted part-of-speech tags are provided as input, it substantially outperforms all previous local models and approaches the best reported results on the CoNLL-2009 dataset. 
    Syntactic parsers are unreliable on out-of-domain data, so standard (i.e. syntactically-informed) SRL models are hindered when tested in this setting. 
    Our syntax-agnostic model appears more robust, resulting in the best reported results on the standard out-of-domain test set.

  title: On the Effects of Low-Quality Training Data on Information Extraction from Clinical Reports
  authors: Diego Marcheggiani, Fabrizio Sebastiani

  abstract: >
    In the last five years there has been a flurry of work on information extraction from clinical documents, i.e., on algorithms capable of extracting, from the informal and unstructured texts that are generated during everyday clinical practice, mentions of concepts relevant to such practice. 
    Many of these research works are about methods based on supervised learning, i.e., methods for training an information extraction system from manually annotated examples. 
    While a lot of work has been devoted to devising learning methods that generate more and more accurate information extractors, no work has been devoted to investigating the effect of the quality of training data on the learning process for the clinical domain. 
    Low quality in training data often derives from the fact that the person who has annotated the data is different from the one against whose judgment the automatically annotated data must be evaluated. 
    In this paper we test the impact of such data quality issues on the accuracy of information extraction systems as applied to the clinical domain. 
    We do this by comparing the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by the authoritative coder (i.e., the one who has also annotated the test data, and by whose judgment we must abide), with the accuracy deriving from training data annotated by a different coder, equally expert in the subject matter. 
    The results indicate that, although the disagreement between the two coders (as measured on the training set) is substantial, the difference is (surprisingly enough) not always statistically significant. 
    While the dataset used in the present work originated in a clinical context, the issues we study in this work are of more general interest.
