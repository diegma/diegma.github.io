    We demonstrate a metadata enrichment system for the Europeana digital library. The system allows different institutions which provide to Europeana pointers (in the form of metadata records - MRs) to their content to enrich their MRs by classifying them under a classification scheme of their choice, and to extract/highlight entities of significant interest within the MRs themselves. The use of a supervised learning metaphor allows each content provider (CP) to generate classifiers and extractors tailored to the CPâ€™s specific needs, thus allowing the tool to be effectively available to the multitude (2000+) of Europeana CPs.

  title: ISTI at TREC Microblog Track 2012 Real-Time Filtering Through Supervised Learning
  authors: Giacomo Berardi, Andrea Esuli, Diego Marcheggiani
  booktitle: Proceedings of the Twenty-first Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)
  doc-url: http://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec21/papers/NEMIS_ISTI_CNR.microblog.final.pdf

  venue: conference
  abstract: >
    Our approach to the microblog filtering task is based on learning a relevance 
    classifier from an initial training set of relevant and non relevant tweets, generated by using 
    a simple retrieval method. The classifier is then retrained using the (simulated) user 
    feedback collected during the training process, in order to improve its accuracy as the 
    filtering process goes on. In the official runs the system scored low effectiveness values, 
    suffering a strong imbalance toward recall.
